## [Cubeton](https://CubeTon.t.me) - Can you tell me more about it ?
### To understand this we need to understand Bots.Business's Administration system in simplified way first:
```
See how BB's Administration system works:

1. Customers come to CLs and ask to make bot
2. Customer pays money to BBAdmin
3. Once the order is complete, the money is stored in Salary wallet of BBAdmin
4. After 30 days the money is sent to all CLs.

```
### [Cubeton](https://CubeTon.t.me) is based on the same idea.
